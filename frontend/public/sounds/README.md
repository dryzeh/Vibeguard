# Emergency Alert Sounds

This directory contains the sound files used for emergency alerts in the nightclub safety monitoring system.

Required files:
- `emergency-alert.mp3`: A high-pitched, attention-grabbing sound that plays when an emergency button is pressed
  - Duration: 1-2 seconds
  - Format: MP3
  - Recommended characteristics:
    - High frequency components (1000-2000 Hz)
    - Pulsing pattern
    - Distinct from ambient music
    - Loud enough to be heard in a nightclub environment

Note: The actual sound file needs to be added here. You can either:
1. Create a custom sound that meets these specifications
2. Purchase a licensed emergency alert sound
3. Use a royalty-free emergency alert sound that meets these requirements

The sound should be tested in a nightclub environment to ensure it's audible over typical music and crowd noise levels.
