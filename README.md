# Node.js Version Management

This project uses [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions. To always use the correct version:

1. Install nvm if you haven't already:
   ```sh
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   ```
2. Run this in your project root before starting development or demos:
   ```sh
   nvm install # This will use the version in .nvmrc (Node 20)
   nvm use
   ```
3. (Optional) Add this to your shell profile to auto-switch Node when you cd into the project:
   ```sh
   cd() {
     builtin cd "$@"
     if [ -f .nvmrc ]; then
       nvm use
     fi
   }
   ```
